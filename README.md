# Calculator
This was a project to help reinforce my knowledge of basic javascript functions.
Writing the calculator code was more doifficulkt that i expected, and if i had to do this again i would that a different approcah, using regex look forward and behind to enable more complicated operations. It was quite frustrating not using eval, but it did help me learn to write better code.
