# Calculator
learning javascript by making a calculator
the hardest part of this challenge was not using eval.
i think if i had built it from the ground up to take more inputs it would be more satisfactory, but adding anything additional at this stage is too complicated. 
i have tried to add squareroots, but since the calculation function does not check for the order of symbols, detecting where the squareroot is was too complicated.
